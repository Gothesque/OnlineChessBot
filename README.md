# ü§ñ Online Chess Bot
[lichess.org](https://lichess.org/) and [chess.com](https://chess.com) are the two most popular online chess platforms. This application provides the user with the top engine move and position evaluation. Once a live online game is started, it automatically pulls the played moves from the webpage's source and helps you do a move. A local stockfish engine then analyzes the position and offers the best move to the user.

## How to config?
Open the configuration file *avaible in the folders chess.com and lichess*. In it, you have different options.
- **window/-**: The size of the window *chess.com only*
- **account/-**: Put your account username and password in so the program can log in by itself *lichess only*
- **engine/elo**: The level of the engine
- **engine/depth**: How depth will the engine watch in the possible moves. Higher values = Slower to calculate, but won't above the max_time value.
- **engine/hash**: To not lose what is already calculated and win a bit of time. It is in MB (uses Ram), and must be a power of 2 (2,4,8,16,...)
- **engine/max_time**: The maximum time in milliseconds the engine has to calculate the move
